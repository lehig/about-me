# Projects

I have been programming since I was 14 years old. I've been interested in many topics in computer science and it is a wide field that has lots of opportunities for exploration. My favorite part of programming is finding creative solutions for complex problems. It fascinates me that from simple zeroes and ones, logic gates, computers have the ability to create incredibly realistic games, they can predict sentences that make sense into existance, and they can keep all of that stored in memory. 

Theses are some of the projects that I've accomplished over the years. I've done a wide range of projects from simple games, to training LLMs, to creating an encryption/decrytion program. I think machine learning is a fascinating new field, which is why I am majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in Machine Learning and Algorithms. 

If you have any questions about any of my projects feel free [to reach out](/ContactMe.md).
