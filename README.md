# About Me

I have been programming since I was 14 years old. I've been interested in many topics in computer science and it is a wide field that has lots of opportunities for exploration. My favorite part of programming is finding creative solutions for complex problems. It fascinates me that from simple zeroes and ones, logic gates, computers have the ability to create incredibly realistic games, they can predict sentences that make sense into existance, and they can keep all of that stored in memory.

Theses are some of the projects that I've accomplished over the years. I've done a wide range of projects from simple games, to training LLMs, to creating an encryption/decrytion program. I think machine learning is a fascinating new field, which is why I am majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in Machine Learning and Algorithms.

If you have any questions about any of my projects feel free [to reach out](/contactme.html).

# Projects

## C-Sharp

### Object-Oriented Programming console projects

- [Journal Entry](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/prove/Develop02) - Using encapsulation, this creates a journal entry and can search through jounral entries
- [Text Memorization](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/prove/Develop03) - Using abstraction, this can be given a piece of text to then hide words and replacing them with underscores
- [Meditation Application](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/prove/Develop04) - Using inheritance and polymorphism, this has four different modes: Activity, Breathing, Listing, and Reflection. Perfect for reflecting at the end of the day.
- [Videos and Comments](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/final/Foundation1) - Using object oriented programming, this makes obejcts of comments and videos and displays them.
- [Shipping Labels](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/final/Foundation2) - Using object oriented programming, this makes objects of customers and creates shipping labels for them

### Complex Projects

- [Send-a-file](https://github.com/lehig/Hello-World/tree/main/SendAFile) - Has different modes that can encrypt/decrypt a file using RSA, or it can send file through a local network.

## Go

- [WebCrawly (webcrwler)](https://github.com/lehig/WebCrawly) - Using parallelism, this goes through a webpage and creates a file.

## JavaScript/HTML

- [4 Player Pong Game](https://lehig.github.io/Pong2-2.0/Pong_Game/) - using JS and HTML to create a web-based game.

## Python

### AI/Deep Learning

- [FyodorAI](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/lehig/2f5f8918891c141b30f981e4b452952a/fyodorai.ipynb) - Using transformers and the Keras-NLP library, this uses several books from the author Fyodor Dostoevsky to create a model that generates text.
- [ShakespeareAI](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/lehig/857863c36618c3770511f995c92b5b2c/shakespearai.ipynb) - Using transformers, this uses several of Shakespeare's works to create a model that generates text based on a prompt.

### Parallelism and Concurrency

- [Parallel Drawing](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week01/assignment/assignment.py) - Using parallelism, this draws shapes in concurrency.
- [StarWars Info Get](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week02/assignment/assignment.py) - This retreives data from a server using concurrency with an API.
- [Greenscreen Removal](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week03/assignment/assignment.py) - This takes pixels from images from a video and replaces them with pixels from another image.
- [Semaphore Practice with Factories and Car Sales](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week04/assignment/assignment.py) - This uses semaphores to limit the amount of cars that produced before selling them.
- [Family Tree Retrieval](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week14/assignment/common.py) - This program requests data from a server and creates a family tree with the reqeusts from an API that takes a second to respond.

### PyGame
- [Arcade Game](https://github.com/jmiko4/Pygame) - This is a simple game using the PyGame library.
