# About Me

I’ve been programming since I was 14 years old, and ever since then, I haven’t stopped learning and creating. What started as a curiosity for how code works has grown into a lifelong passion for building systems that are efficient, secure, and meaningful.

I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with an emphasis in Algorithms and Machine Learning at Brigham Young University–Idaho, where I’ve gained a deep understanding of how math, logic, and good software design come together to solve real-world problems.

Recently, I interned as a Software Engineer at BoomID, where I developed cloud-based systems using Go and AWS to analyze photo metadata for biometric authentication and designed a secure “lock box” for encrypted file sharing. Through that experience, I discovered how much I enjoy bridging front-end, back-end, and cloud architecture to deliver full solutions.

Beyond the technical side, I’ve also worked in customer-facing roles where I learned the importance of empathy, clear communication, and teamwork—skills that now influence how I approach both people and code.

I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, continuously improving my craft, and collaborating on projects that make a difference. I’m currently working on several personal projects involving Go, React, and AWS, with the goal of refining my skills in full-stack and cloud-native development.

Theses are some of the projects that I've accomplished over the years. I've done a wide range of projects from simple games, to training LLMs, to creating an encryption/decrytion program. I think machine learning is a fascinating new field, which is why I am majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in Machine Learning and Algorithms.

# Projects

## C-Sharp

### Object-Oriented Programming console projects

- [Journal Entry](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/prove/Develop02) - Using encapsulation, this creates a journal entry and can search through jounral entries
- [Text Memorization](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/prove/Develop03) - Using abstraction, this can be given a piece of text to then hide words and replacing them with underscores
- [Meditation Application](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/prove/Develop04) - Using inheritance and polymorphism, this has four different modes: Activity, Breathing, Listing, and Reflection. Perfect for reflecting at the end of the day.
- [Videos and Comments](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/final/Foundation1) - Using object oriented programming, this makes obejcts of comments and videos and displays them.
- [Shipping Labels](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/final/Foundation2) - Using object oriented programming, this makes objects of customers and creates shipping labels for them

### Complex Projects

- [Send-a-file](https://github.com/lehig/Hello-World/tree/main/SendAFile) - Has different modes that can encrypt/decrypt a file using RSA, or it can send file through a local network.

## Go

- [WebCrawly (webcrwler)](https://github.com/lehig/WebCrawly) - Using parallelism, this goes through a webpage and creates a file.

## JavaScript/HTML

- [4 Player Pong Game](https://lehig.github.io/Pong2-2.0/Pong_Game/) - using JS and HTML to create a web-based game.

## Python

### AI/Deep Learning

- [FyodorAI](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/lehig/2f5f8918891c141b30f981e4b452952a/fyodorai.ipynb) - Using transformers and the Keras-NLP library, this uses several books from the author Fyodor Dostoevsky to create a model that generates text.
- [ShakespeareAI](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/lehig/857863c36618c3770511f995c92b5b2c/shakespearai.ipynb) - Using transformers, this uses several of Shakespeare's works to create a model that generates text based on a prompt.

### Parallelism and Concurrency

- [Parallel Drawing](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week01/assignment/assignment.py) - Using parallelism, this draws shapes in concurrency.
- [StarWars Info Get](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week02/assignment/assignment.py) - This retreives data from a server using concurrency with an API.
- [Greenscreen Removal](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week03/assignment/assignment.py) - This takes pixels from images from a video and replaces them with pixels from another image.
- [Semaphore Practice with Factories and Car Sales](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week04/assignment/assignment.py) - This uses semaphores to limit the amount of cars that produced before selling them.
- [Family Tree Retrieval](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week14/assignment/common.py) - This program requests data from a server and creates a family tree with the reqeusts from an API that takes a second to respond.

### PyGame
- [Arcade Game](https://github.com/jmiko4/Pygame) - This is a simple game using the PyGame library.
