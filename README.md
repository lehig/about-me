# About Me (React)

This project has been refactored from Quarto-generated static HTML to a React app using Vite.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production build

npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Project structure

- `src/App.jsx`: Portfolio layout and rendering logic.
- `src/data/content.js`: About text, project links, and contact details.
- `src/styles.css`: App styling.

## Notes

- Legacy Quarto output files were removed.
- Update your portfolio content by editing `src/data/content.js`.
