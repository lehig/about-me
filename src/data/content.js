  "I’m the kind of engineer who encounters a problem and researches if it’s been solved before. I enjoy using what I learned from school, creators I follow, and videos I watch and implement those into real solutions. I naturally think from the user’s point of view to make it as simple for the user as possible. The most optimal user experience is pressing a button and allowing the program to work. When I build something, I usually start by just creating that first file, thinking about the landing page, or understanding the data and then iterating from there.", 
  "I’ve learned that good software requires clean, legible code with string logging, so that when it fails, you know where and how it failed. The hardest thing I’ve built so far was a platform supporting different types of users with unique roles and behaviors. It pushed me into areas I didn’t know well at the time like web development, cloud infrastructure, and backend systems, but the result is a fully functional product ready to be used. This experience taught me the fundamentals of full-stack development, RESTful APIs, and AWS. From that experience, I learned that no problem is impossible. Solutions sometimes just take time, experimentation, and iteration.",
  "Right now I’m continuing to grow in machine learning while building real projects that strengthen my engineering skills. Long term, I want to become the kind of engineer who understands the mission behind the product, works closely with both technical and business perspectives, and build with a clear purpose rather than just writing code for the sake of it.",
